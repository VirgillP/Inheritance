# Inheritance
Updated this sample program. 
Outputting the public, protected and private members with output functions within each of the parent lassess.

Sub classes inherit capabilities of parent classes by invoking(calling) a function from a parentclass through the use of sub classes objects. This means that objects of subclasses can have the same capabilities as the subclasses's partentclasses.

With this program sample each subclass is immediately given an object name, object0, object1, object2 between the last curly bracket and semi-colon of a sub class. Nothing special here. Object names can also be defined within 'main' function.
Accessing each function within the parentclasses is possible thanks to the visibility specifier.
Feel free to experiment further with it. Learn more about the meaning and use of making members(either functions and/or variable)public, private and protected.
