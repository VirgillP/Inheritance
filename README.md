# Inheritance
Updated this sample program. 
I have outputted the public, protected and private members with output functions within each of the classess.
Sub classes inheriting capabilities of parent classes;
objects of subclasses can have the same capabilities as the subclasses's partentclasses.
With this program sample each subclass is immediately given an object name, object0, object1, object2. Nothing special here.
Object names can also be defined withing main.
Accessing each function within the parentclasses is possible thanks to the visibility specifier.
Feel free to experiment further with it. Take note of public, private and protected. Get to know them.
